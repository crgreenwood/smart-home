# Smart-Home

Home automation project intended to give me a better understanding of smart home tech.

>Note this is a development project, nothing here may be of any use to man nor beast!

## Getting Started

* Hass.io on ESXi
* Hass.io static IP
* Add-ons
  * Configurator 
  * Node-Red
  * SSH & Web Terminal
  * Samba
  * Portainer
  * NGINX
* Integrations
  * Sure Petcare
  * Loop Energy Monitor
  * Others (the easy ones)

### Prerequisites

This was built on what I had available at the time, very little of what is here was created by me, I've just gathered together best practice to ensure that if I ever have to rebuild it, I have documented what I have!
