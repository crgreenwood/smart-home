# Smart-Home

Home automation project intended to give me a good understanding of smart home tech but with a more stable infrastructure backing (because why not)

>Note this is a development project, nothing here may be of any use to man nor beast!

## Getting Started

* [Kubernetes](docs/kubernetes.md)
* Helm
* MariaDB
* Hass.io
* Node-Red

### Prerequisites

This was built on what I had available at the time, namely a vSphere host and a RaspberryPi, I've tried to make this platform agnostic wherever possible.
